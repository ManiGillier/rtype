This folder name used to be "packet"
This was indeed a very cool name, and I very much felt like a godly skilled programmer by using such a language to name my folder

But, this folder that is included both in the server and the client needs to have more than packet-related code, so its name is now "shared"
(because of Mani)

Would you please, for me, pretend as if this folder name was "packets" ? And appreciate the way I code ? and develop ? And use my skills to produce
insanely good written code.
Thank you in advance, and for your reading.
