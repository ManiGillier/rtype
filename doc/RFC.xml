</section>
<section anchor="context"><name>Context</name>

<t>At the EuroPean Institute of TECHnology (EPITECH), there is a project
called "R-Type".<br />
The goal is to make a multiplayer game with a greatly implemented architecture.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="motivations"><name>Motivations</name>

<t>This document was created to allow precise definition for the
communication protocol used in the multiplayer game "R-Type" mentionned
in the context above.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="protocol-overview"><name>Protocol overview</name>

<t>This protocol is a binary protocol.<br />
It is TCP <xref target="STD7"></xref> &amp; UDP [RFC768] based and totally asyncronous.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="definitions"><name>Definitions</name>

<t>The "Server" is a single program responsible of handling one or multiple
"Clients".<br />
The term "Player" <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used as a replacement of the term "Client", but this is context-dependant.<br />
The "Client" is a single program responsible of connecting to the server
in order to represent the game itself.<br />
A "Packet" is a short data structure of well-defined size. It is
exchanged between the server and the clients. A packet <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
exchanged between clients.<br />
NO direct communication <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> interface clients.<br />
The "Game" represents the "R-Type" game that the "Server" and "Clients"
represent together.<br />
This game is a syncronized multiplayer one, where different clients
can connect and play together.<br />
Each client represents a player that can move up, down, left or right.<br />
A player is composed of a "Laser".</t>

</section>
<section anchor="connection"><name>Connection</name>

<t>The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> init the connection in order to join a game.<br />
The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> accept all connections on a given port before the game
starts.<br />
A client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> disconnect at any time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="disconnection"><name>Disconnection</name>

<t>The server CAN disconnect a client at any time, for any reason.<br />
If a client disconnects, or a client is disconnected, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> aknowledge this, and react accordingly with regards to the state of the game.<br />
The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> inform all of the connected clients of the disconnection.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="packets"><name>Packets</name>

<section anchor="structure-of-a-packet"><name>Structure of a packet</name>

<t>A packet consists of:<br />
- A single index byte, later referenced as the "index".<br />
- Multiple data bytes, later referenced as the "data".<br />
  For integer-type data, the endianness <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be determined as network-byte-order (as defined in the IP specification) [RFC791].<br />
  The index defines the size of the data.<br />
  The data is a group of multiple variables, defined and ordered solely by the index.<br />
  The type of the variables is also defined by the index.
A packet is unidirectionnal. It can either be sent by the client, and
receptionned by the server, or sent by the server, and receptionned
by the targeted client.<br />
A packet COULD be used bidirectionally, but it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be limited to strict cases defined in this document.
A packet <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be sent separated, but they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent in one piece.<br />
Any receiver of packets <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> handle the case of incomplete packet reception.
If an incomplete packet is received, the receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> wait for the full packet
to arrive before processing it.
Alternatively, the receiver <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> discard any non-complete packets, especially those sent over UDP.</t>

<section anchor="server-authentification"><name>Server Authentification</name>

<t>When a client connects, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> open a TCP and a UDP connection to the server, and this packet <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used by the server to associate the client to those two connections.</t>

<t>This packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>:<br />

</section>
<section anchor="client-authentification"><name>Client Authentification</name>

<t>This packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>:<br />

<t>The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the "UUID" of this packet is conform with the one he chose.
The server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> answer this packet with the Authentified packet.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="authentified"><name>Authentified</name>

<t>This packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>:<br />
- Be an answer to a correct Client Authentification packet.<br />

The server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> discard this packet if it doesn't authorize opening a new game.</t>

      <abstract>
        <t>This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.</t>
