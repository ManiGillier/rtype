<section anchor="context"><name>Context</name>

<t>At the EuroPean Institute of TECHnology (EPITECH), there is a project
called "R-Type".<br />
The goal is to make a multiplayer game with a greatly implemented architecture.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="motivations"><name>Motivations</name>

<t>This document was created to allow precise definition for the
communication protocol used in the multiplayer game "R-Type" mentionned
in the context above.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="protocol-overview"><name>Protocol overview</name>

<t>This protocol is a binary protocol.<br />
It is TCP <xref target="STD7"></xref> &amp; UDP [RFC768] based and totally asyncronous.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="definitions"><name>Definitions</name>

<t>The "Server" is a single program responsible of handling one or multiple
"Clients".<br />
The term "Player" <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used as a replacement of the term "Client", but this is context-dependant.<br />
The "Client" is a single program responsible of connecting to the server
in order to represent the game itself.<br />
A "Packet" is a data structure following the single responsability principle. It is
exchanged between the server and the clients, and/or rcon. A packet <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be
exchanged between clients.<br />
NO direct communication <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> interface clients.<br />
NO direct communication <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> interface client and rcon.<br />
The "Game" represents the "R-Type" game that the "Server" and "Clients"
represent together.<br />
This game is a syncronized multiplayer one, where different clients
can connect and play together.<br />
Each client represents a player that can move up, down, left or right.<br />
A player is composed of a "Laser".
A "lobby" is a sub-server allowing a limited number of players to join a game.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="connection"><name>Connection</name>

<t>The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> init the connection in order to join a game.<br />
The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> accept all connections on a given port before the game
starts.<br />
A client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> disconnect at any time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="disconnection"><name>Disconnection</name>

<t>The server CAN disconnect a client at any time, for any reason.<br />
If a client disconnects, or a client is disconnected, the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> aknowledge this, and react accordingly with regards to the state of the game.<br />
The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> inform all of the connected clients of the disconnection.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="packets"><name>Packets</name>

<section anchor="packet-definition"><name>Packet definition</name>

<t>A packet is unidirectionnal. It CAN either be sent by the client, and
receptionned by the server, or sent by the server, and receptionned
by the targeted client.<br />
A packet COULD be used bidirectionally, but it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be limited to strict cases defined in this document.<br />
A packet <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be sent separated, but they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent in one piece.<br />
Any receiver of packets <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> handle the case of incomplete packet reception.
If an incomplete packet is received, the receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> wait for the full packet
to arrive before processing it.
Alternatively, the receiver <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> discard any non-complete packets, especially those sent over UDP.</t>

<t>A packet is described by four informations:<br />
- The type, either UDP or TCP.<br />
- The sender, either the client, the server or the rcon.<br />
- The index, determining how the data will be read.<br />
- The data scheme, defining what will be later referenced as the "data" of a packet.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="compression-of-packets"><name>Compression of packets</name>

<t>The data of a packet <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> BE compressed using the deflate algorithm from the zlib standard library.</t>

<t>The resulting data will be referenced as the compressed data.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="final-form-of-the-packet"><name>Final form of the packet</name>

<t>For every packet, the following bytes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The index byte.</t>
  <t>A four byte unsigned integer representing the data size in bytes before compression.</t>
  <t>A four byte unsigned integer representing the compressed data size in bytes.</t>
  <t>The compressed data.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This is the sent bytes that represent a complete packet.</t>

<t>For UDP packets sent from the server to a client, an unsigned 16 bits integer <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> BE prefixed to the final form before sending.<br />
This is the packet sequence ID.<br />
It CAN be used by the client to compute a packet lossage percentage.<br />
It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> increment by one for every UDP packet sent to this exact client.<br />
If a sequence number is the maximum 16 bits unsigned integer, the next sequence number <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> BE 0.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="variable-packet-size"><name>Variable packet size</name>

<t>Some packet are of variable size.</t>

<t>This may include the usage of strings of characters, or the usage of a list of objects.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="string-format"><name>String format</name>

<t>A string of character <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> BE written in the following format:<br />
- A four bytes unsigned integer containing the number of characters in the string, excluding the NULL byte.<br />
- Every characters of the string in order, excluding the NULL byte.
Every character <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be represented by a single byte, in the ASCII format [RFC20].</t>

<t>A string <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be of more than 256 characters.<br />
A program receiving a string of more that 256 characters <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> discard it.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="format-of-a-list-of-object"><name>Format of a List of object</name>

<t>A list of object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> BE written in the following format:<br />
- A two bytes unsigned integer containing the number of objects in the list.<br />
- All bytes composing each object, without delimitation between objects.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="list-of-packets"><name>List of packets</name>

<section anchor="server-authentification"><name>Server Authentification</name>

<t>When a client connects, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> open a TCP and a UDP connection to the server, and this packet <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used by the server to associate the client to those two connections.</t>

      <author fullname="W. Eddy" initials="W." role="editor" surname="Eddy"/>
      <date month="August" year="2022"/>
      <abstract>
        <t>This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These words are often capitalized. This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>
